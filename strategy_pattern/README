Strategy is a behavioral design pattern.

The strategy design pattern defines a family of algorithms called strategies or behaviors, encapsulates each one
and makes them interchangeable from each other and thus the pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from the client that use it.
The strategies that inherit from the base strategy are called concrete strategies.

This pattern uses composition meaning having an object that holds reference to the strategy that is going to be executed.
In this case once the navigator object is created it has a default walking strategy, but it can be changed anytime to driving or public transport.
