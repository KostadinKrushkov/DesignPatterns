Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their class.
It delegates the cloning process to the actual objects that are being cloned. An object that supports cloning is called a prototype.

The pattern consists of a Prototype, Concrete Prototypes and a Client that creates the objects calls the clone to get a copy.

This pattern is especially useful when:
- Your code shouldn't depend on the concrete classes of objects that you need to copy
- You want to reduce the number of subclasses that only differ in initialization
- You want to clone objects without coupling to their concrete classes
But:
- Cloning complex objects that have circular reference might be very tricky
