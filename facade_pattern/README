Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces/frameworks/classes or a library in a subsystem.
It provides a higher level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

The pattern uses the principle of least knowledge because of less coupling. In other words talk only to your immediate friends
If you have object "a" with object "b" and "b" has "c"
"a" can access "b" but can't access "c" -> reduced coupling (a.b.c it's not allowed to access c from a)

This pattern is especially useful when:
- You need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex system
- You want to structure a subsystem into layers
